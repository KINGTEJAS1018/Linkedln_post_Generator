## Overview

The LinkedIn Post Generator is an AI-powered application that analyzes your historical LinkedIn posts and generates new content matching your unique writing style. Using a two-stage architecture with Llama3.2, it learns from your past posts and creates personalized content that maintains consistency with your voice.

## 🚀 Problem & Solution

```

### Stage 2: Post Generation
```
[Topic, Language, Length] → Generate Prompt → Generate Post (Llama3.2) → Final Post
            ↓                                        ↑

## 📊 Example

**Input**: Topic: Job Search, Length: Medium, Language: English

**Output**:
```
Job seekers, don't lose hope. Every 'no' brings you closer to the 'yes' you deserve. 
I know it's tough, with each rejection feeling like a step back. But here's the truth: 
it's not about you, it's about finding the right fit. 60% of job applicants never get 
a response - the system is broken, not you. Your self-worth isn't defined by a job 
title or a salary. Take care of your mental health, and the right opportunity will come. 💪
```
